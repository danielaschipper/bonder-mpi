Computes regions of non covalent interactions using promolecular estamates of electron densities
Uses MPI for cluster based computaion. unlike other versions of bonder this can only do all interactions. Use this if you want to do entire proteins.

Making bonder
Step one: have an MPI compiler, I use mpic++ if you use a differnt one edit the makefile
Step two: run make
step three: copy the mpibond excutable to where you want to install it

Usage
bond h will give the varous modes the program has
calling bond with just a letter will tell you the proper arguments for that mode of opperation
